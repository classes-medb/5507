2998  1. Introduction
2999  
3000  Today, you will analyze some data sets
3001  that have a mix of categorical and
3002  continuous variables. The first data
3003  set looks at pumonary function in a
3004  group of children.
3005  
3006  You can find a description of this data set at
3007  
3008    http://jse.amstat.org/datasets/fev.txt

3012  2. Data and output locations
3013  
3014  Here are the standard commands to tell
3015  SAS where to find the data, where to
3016  place its own data files and where to
3017  store the output.
3018  ********* ********* ********* *********;
3019  
3020  filename raw_data
3021    "../data/fev.txt";
3022  
3023  libname intro
3024    "../data";

3030  3. Labels for categorical data
3031  
3032  There are several categorical variables
3033  in this data set with number codes, so
3034  you should define labels for those
3035  codes.
3036  ********* ********* ********* *********;
3037  
3038  proc format;
3039    value fsex
3040      0 = "Female"
3041      1 = "Male"
3042    ;
NOTE: Format FSEX is already on the library WORK.FORMATS.
NOTE: Format FSEX has been output.
3043    value fsmoke
3044      0 = "Nonsmoker"
3045      1 = "Smoker"
3046    ;
NOTE: Format FSMOKE is already on the library WORK.FORMATS.
NOTE: Format FSMOKE has been output.
3047  run;

3050  4. Reading the data using a data step
3051  
3052  The data file is comma delimited and
3053  the first row includes variable names.
3054  
3055  Normally, this means that you can save
3056  a bit of time by using proc import,
3057  but I chose to read in the data using
3058  a data step. The number of variables
3059  was so small that this didn't matter
3060  that much. It also allowed me to define
3061  variable labels in the initial data
3062  step rather than later.
3063  ********* ********* ********* *********;
3064  
3065  data intro.fev;
3066    infile raw_data delimiter="," firstobs=2;
3067    input age fev ht sex smoke;
3068    label
3069      age=Age in years
3070      fev=Forced Expiratory Volume (liters)
3071      ht=Height in inches
3072      sex=Sex
3073      smoke=Smoking status
3074    ;
3075  run;

NOTE: The infile RAW_DATA is:
      Filename=C:\Users\simons\Documents\SASUniversityEdition\myfolders\introduction-to-sas\basics3\data\fev.txt,
      RECFM=V,LRECL=32767,File Size (bytes)=11219,
      Last Modified=22Jul2019:11:27:14,
      Create Time=22Jul2019:11:27:14

NOTE: 654 records were read from the infile RAW_DATA.
      The minimum record length was 12.
      The maximum record length was 17.
NOTE: The data set INTRO.FEV has 654 observations and 5 variables.

3076  
3077  ********* ********* ********* *********
3078  5. Print the first ten rows of data
3079  
3080  It's alsways a good idea to peek at
3081  the first few rows of data.

3096  6. Proc freq and proc means
3097  
3098  There is a mix of categorical and
3099  continuous variables in this data set.
3100  Recall that you use proc freq for
3101  categorical variables and proc means
3102  for continuous variables.
3103  
3104  Always get in the habit of checking for
3105  missing values.

3123  
3124  ********* ********* ********* *********
3125  7. Pearson correlation, proc corr
3126  
3127  The Pearson correlation coefficient
3128  gives you a numeric measure of the
3129  strength of association between two
3130  continuous variables.

3139  
3140  ********* ********* ********* *********
3141  8. Scatterplot, proc sgplot
3142  
3143  You should also examine the association
3144  between continuous variables using a
3145  scatterplot.
3146  
3147  I am only showing the plot of ht
3148  versus fev, but you should also
3149  examine the plot of age versus
3150  fev.
3151  ********* ********* ********* *********;
3152  
3153  title2 "Scatterplots";
3154  proc sgplot
3155      data=intro.fev;
3156    scatter x=age y=fev;
3157  run;

3158  
3159  ********* ********* ********* *********
3160  9. Scatterplot, smoothing curve
3161  
3162  Sometimes a trend line can help. You
3163  should consider a smoothing method
3164  like loess or pbspline, as this will
3165  help you visualize any potential
3166  nonlinear relationships.
3167  ********* ********* ********* *********;
3168  
3169  title3 "with loess, smooth=0.1";
3170  proc sgplot
3171      data=intro.fev;
3172    scatter x=ht y=fev;
3173    loess x=ht y=fev /
3174      nomarkers
3175      smooth=0.1
3176      lineattrs=(color=Red);
3177  run;

NOTE: PROCEDURE SGPLOT used (Total process time):
      real time           0.66 seconds

NOTE: There were 654 observations read from the data set INTRO.FEV.

3178  
3179  ********* ********* ********* *********
3180  10. Boxplot, proc sgplot
3181  
3182  When you want to look at a relationship
3183  between a categorical variable and a
3184  continuous variable, you should use a
3185  boxplot.
3186  
3187  Notice that you use proc sgplot for
3188  both a scatterplot and a boxplot. This
3189  is a big improvement over previous
3190  methods in SAS to produce plots
3191  because it is easier to learn one
3192  procedure and minor variations in that
3193  procedure rather than having to learn
3194  multiple procedures.
3195  ********* ********* ********* *********;
3196  
3197  title2 "Boxplots";
3198  proc sgplot
3199      data=intro.fev;
3200    vbox fev / category=smoke;
3201    format smoke fsmoke.;
3202  run;

3203  
3204  ********* ********* ********* *********
3205  11. Descriptive statistics, by statement
3206  
3207  Also look at how the means and standard
3208  deviations of your continuous variable
3209  change for each level of your
3210  categorical variable.
3211  ********* ********* ********* *********;
3212  
3213  proc sort
3214      data=intro.fev;
3215    by smoke;
3216  run;

NOTE: There were 654 observations read from the data set INTRO.FEV.
NOTE: The data set INTRO.FEV has 654 observations and 5 variables.

3217  
3218  proc means
3219      data=intro.fev;
3220    var fev;
3221    by smoke;

3225  
3226  ********* ********* ********* *********
3227  12. Investigate unusual trend, proc sgplot and means
3228  
3229  This is very odd. You can get a hint as
3230  to why smokers might have higher fev
3231  values than non-smokers by looking at
3232  how age and smoking status are related.
3233  ********* ********* ********* *********;
3234  
3235  proc sgplot
3236      data=intro.fev;

3249  
3250  ********* ********* ********* *********
3251  13. Further investigation on your own
3252  
3253  You should also examine the
3254  relationship between sex and fev. Do
3255  this on your own, but there is no need
3256  to turn anything in.
