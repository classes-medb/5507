* VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS:  
Age = the patient's age in years
AgeGroup = the age group in which the patient falls (0 = 11-17 years, 1 = 18-26 years)
Race = the patient's race (0 = white, 1 = black, 2 = Hispanic, 3 = other/unknown)
Shots = the number of shots that the patients completed during a period of 12 months from
the time of the first shot
Completed = did the patient complete the three-shot regimen within the recommended period
of 12 months (0 = no, 1 = yes)
InsuranceType = the type of insurance that the patient had (0 = medical assistance, 1 = 
private payer [Blue Cross Blue Shield, Aetna, Cigna, United, Commercial, CareFirst], 2 = 
hospital based [EHF], 3 = military [USFHP, Tricare, MA])
MedAssist = did the patient have some type of medical assistance (0 = no, 1 = yes)
Location = the clinic that the patient attended (1 = Odenton, 2 = White Marsh, 3 = 
Johns Hopkins Outpatient Center, 4 = Bayview)
LocationType = was the clinic in a suburban or an urban location (0 = suburban, 1 = urban)
PracticeType = the type of practice that the patient visited (0 = pediatric, 1 = family
practice, 2 = OB-GYN);
