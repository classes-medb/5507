### Getting started

<div class="notes">

I'm going to record several extra lectures. If you're having trouble running SAS, it's okay. Your first program is the hardest.

History of SAS. If you understand where SAS comes from, you understand some of the limitations.

This is on my blog.

SAS was developed at NC State. SAS Institute was formed in 1976. It is a privately held company.

The SAS Headquarters is in Cary, NC, and it is huge. It is a pretty nice place to work.

In the 1960's, IBM mainframes dominated. So SAS was originally written just for these systems. Originally, SAS was written in a mix of PL/1, Fortran, and Assembler. Millions of lines of code re-written in C in 1985 so that SAS could run on personal computers.

Talk about JMP. Extensive use of dynamic graphics. If you can see a demo, it is pretty amazing.

SAS is oriented around various data sets and procedures. There is a menu driven version of SAS, but it is not very good. If you want a good package that is totally menu driven, use SPSS.

SAS has a licensing model that is prohibitive for individual consultants. They offer a free product, SAS University, that is intended for teaching.

SAS has literally hundreds of books. It has a certification program. 

SAS was built in the 1960s. There is very little software written in the 1960s. It shows the staying power, but it is "long in the tooth."

I'll show some more videos about SAS.
